    "\n",
    "<b>The functional paradigm</b> focusses on:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><b>Structuring your code</b>, so that the program uses subroutine/function calls (executing another program parts from elsewhere during the runtime).\n",

    "<li>\n",
    "    <b>Statelessness</b>, hence <b>it shouldn't matter when a function is called.</b> As long as the same input is used, the function should yield the same output. <b>Hence functions are only loosely coupled to data</b> outside of their scope.\n",

The interaction of these objects with the environment takes place via <b><i>special object methods</i></b>, the so-called <b><i>interfaces</i></b>, to avoid direct manipulation of object attributes from outside <b>ensuring data security.</b> <b>Statefulness implies</b> that the <b>execution order of object methods can matter.</b>\n",

    "<font size=\"3\">\n",
    "    In Python, every class is an object and is implicitly a subclass of a built-in class called <b>object</b>. This means that the <b>object</b> class is the base class for all Python classes, and provides a set of default methods and attributes that are inherited by all objects in Python. We have already used the <b>__init__</b> method as one of the inherited methods.\n",
    "In particular when dealing with arbitrary Python objects and when we have no code documentation available, some builtin Python functions can be very useful. Like the <b>__init__</b> method, you can use these built-in attribtes and methods as a starting point and override them.<br>\n",

    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li> __init__(self[, args...]): This is the constructor method that is called when a new instance of the class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes and to perform any other setup that is necessary.\n",
    "        <li> __str__(self): This method returns a string representation of the object, and is used when the object is printed. It is often used to provide a human-readable description of the object.\n",
    "        <li> __repr__(self): This method returns a string representation of the object that can be used to recreate the object. It is used when the object is represented in code, such as when it is printed within a list or dictionary.\n",
    "        <li> __setattr__(self, name, value): This method is called when an attribute of the object is set, and allows you to customize how attributes are set. This can be useful for enforcing data validation or for performing other actions when an attribute is set.\n",
    "        <li> __getattr__(self, name): This method is called when an attribute of the object is accessed that doesn't exist, and allows you to customize how missing attributes are handled. This can be useful for providing default values or for dynamically generating attributes.\n",
    "        <li> __del__(self): This method is called when the object is deleted, and allows you to perform cleanup actions before the object is destroyed. This can be useful for releasing resources or for performing other actions that need to be taken when the object is no longer needed.\n",
    "        <li> __dir__(self): This method lists all methods and builtin methods of an object.        \n",
    "        <li> __eq__() is a method that is called when comparing two objects for equality using the == operator.\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <b>Here are some useful built-in attributes:</b>\n",

    "### 1.4 Getter and setter methods\n",
    "<font size=\"3\">\n",
    "    In object-oriented programming, a getter and a setter are methods used to control access to an object's attributes. A getter is a method that retrieves the value of an attribute, while a setter is a method that sets the value of an attribute.<br><br>\n",
    "    In some programming languages, such as Java and C#, the use of getters and setters is enforced by the language, and properties are used to provide access to the attributes of an object. In Python, the use of getters and setters is optional, as Python does not have the concept of private attributes. However, there are still some benefits to using getters and setters in Python.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main benefits of using getters and setters is that they allow us to control the access to the attributes of an object. This means that we can ensure that the attributes are only accessed and modified in a controlled and consistent manner. This can help to prevent bugs and errors in our code, and can make it easier to maintain and extend our code over time.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of using getters and setters is that they allow us to add additional functionality to the getting and setting of an attribute. For example, we could use a setter method to validate the value that is being assigned to an attribute, or to trigger some other action when the attribute is modified. Similarly, we could use a getter method to calculate the value of an attribute on the fly, rather than storing it as a static value.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using getters and setters can also help to improve the readability and maintainability of our code. By encapsulating the attributes within our objects, we can create a clear separation between the data and the behavior of our objects. This can make it easier to understand and reason about our code, and can help to make our code more modular and reusable.<br><br>\n",

    "    Above is a very straight-forward implementation of getter and setter. However, there is a more elegant way to implement getter and setter in Python using the <b>@property</b> decorator.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The <b>@property</b> decorator is a built-in decorator that provides a way to define a method as a getter or a setter for a specific attribute without changing the way the attribute is accessed from outside the object. This means that you can access the property method for an attribute using dot notation as if it were a regular attribute, even though it's being controlled by the getter and setter methods.<br><br>\n",

    "    Modularization in Python is the process of breaking down a large program into smaller, more manageable pieces, or modules. Each module is a self-contained unit of code that can be reused in other programs, making it easier to write, test, and maintain software.<br><br>\n",
    "Python modules are files containing Python code that define functions, classes, and other objects. Modules can be imported into other Python programs to make use of their code. By dividing a program into modules, it becomes easier to organize and maintain the code. These modules can be installed using the Python Package Index (PyPI), which is a repository of Python packages that can be easily installed using pip, the package installer for Python.<br><br>\n",
    "Modularization in Python is typically achieved by creating separate Python files for each module and organizing these files into a directory hierarchy. <br><br>\n",
    "The benefits of modularization in Python include:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li> Reusability: Modules can be reused in other programs, saving time and effort.\n",
    "        <li> Maintainability: By breaking down a program into smaller modules, it becomes easier to test and maintain.\n",
    "        <li> Scalability: A modular program can be easily scaled up or down by adding or removing modules.\n",
    "        <li> Collaboration: Modularization makes it easier for multiple developers to work on a program at the same time.        \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "Structuring the code in functions which can be easily reused and maintained is the first step to achieve cleaner and leaner code. Nevertheless, in big Python projects, it would result in not really well readable code and collaborating on a common project would be difficult, if all the code would be in one single file. Nowadays Python projects are therefore organised in modules, allowing to distribute parts of the code over multiple files as well.<br><br> The figure below shows an exemplaric project directory structure organized in modules and submodules:<br><br>\n",
