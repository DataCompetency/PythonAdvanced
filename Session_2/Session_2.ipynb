A programming paradigm is a style, philosophy or a set of principles followed in structuring your code and the way to implement its intended functionality. Among the various paradigms, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming\"><b>functional</b></a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming\"><b>object-oriented programming (OOP)</b></a> paradigm are the most popular, also in Python.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The functional paradigm</b> focusses on:\n",

    "<li><b>Structuring your code</b>, so that the program uses subroutine/function calls (executing another program parts from elsewhere during the runtime).\n",

    "<li>\n",
    "    <b>Statelessness</b>, hence <b>it shouldn't matter when a function is called.</b> As long as the same input is used, the function should yield the same output. <b>Hence functions are only loosely coupled to data</b> outside of their scope.\n",
    "</li>\n",

    "<b>The data (its state) is strictly bound to the object.</b>\n",

    "<li><b>States</b> since the objects (can) store a state in their attributes. The interaction of these objects with the environment takes place via <b><i>special object methods</i></b>, the so-called <b><i>interfaces</i></b>, to avoid direct manipulation of object attributes from outside <b>ensuring data security.</b> <b>Statefulness implies</b> that the <b>execution order of object methods can matter.</b>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<b>Classes grouped in modules</b> so that the objects have the specific environments to work in. This allows <b>easy extensibility</b>.\n",

    "### 1.4 Getter and setter methods\n",
    "<font size=\"3\">\n",
    "    In object-oriented programming, a getter and a setter are methods used to control access to an object's attributes. A getter is a method that retrieves the value of an attribute, while a setter is a method that sets the value of an attribute.<br><br>\n",
    "    In some programming languages, such as Java and C#, the use of getters and setters is enforced by the language, and properties are used to provide access to the attributes of an object. In Python, the use of getters and setters is optional, as Python does not have the concept of private attributes. However, there are still some benefits to using getters and setters in Python.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main benefits of using getters and setters is that they allow us to control the access to the attributes of an object. This means that we can ensure that the attributes are only accessed and modified in a controlled and consistent manner. This can help to prevent bugs and errors in our code, and can make it easier to maintain and extend our code over time.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of using getters and setters is that they allow us to add additional functionality to the getting and setting of an attribute. For example, we could use a setter method to validate the value that is being assigned to an attribute, or to trigger some other action when the attribute is modified. Similarly, we could use a getter method to calculate the value of an attribute on the fly, rather than storing it as a static value.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using getters and setters can also help to improve the readability and maintainability of our code. By encapsulating the attributes within our objects, we can create a clear separation between the data and the behavior of our objects. This can make it easier to understand and reason about our code, and can help to make our code more modular and reusable.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of getters and setters is optional in Python, they still provide a number of benefits in terms of control, extensibility, and maintainability of our code.\n",

    "    When applied to a method in a class definition, the <b>@property</b> decorator transforms the method into a \"getter\" method, which can be used to retrieve the value of an attribute. Additionally, you can define a \"setter\" method for the same attribute by using the <b>@property_name.setter</b> decorator.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    By using the property decorator, we can achieve the same level of control over access to the attributes of a class, but with more concise and readable code. Additionally, we can take advantage of Python's built-in decorators to easily define getters and setters for all the attributes of a class, making our code more modular and reusable.    \n",

    "    Modularization in Python is the process of breaking down a large program into smaller, more manageable pieces, or modules. Each module is a self-contained unit of code that can be reused in other programs, making it easier to write, test, and maintain software.<br><br>\n",
    "Python modules are files containing Python code that define functions, classes, and other objects. Modules can be imported into other Python programs to make use of their code. By dividing a program into modules, it becomes easier to organize and maintain the code. These modules can be installed using the Python Package Index (PyPI), which is a repository of Python packages that can be easily installed using pip, the package installer for Python.<br><br>\n",

    "        <li> Scalability: A modular program can be easily scaled up or down by adding or removing modules.\n",

    "    </ul>\n",
    "Structuring the code in functions which can be easily reused and maintained is the first step to achieve cleaner and leaner code. Nevertheless, in big Python projects, it would result in not really well readable code and collaborating on a common project would be difficult, if all the code would be in one single file. Nowadays Python projects are therefore organised in modules, allowing to distribute parts of the code over multiple files as well.<br><br> The figure below shows an exemplaric project directory structure organized in modules and submodules:<br><br>\n",
