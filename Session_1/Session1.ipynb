Instead, you use the <i>yield</i> keyword to define a function that generates a sequence of values, one at a time. When the function encounters a yield statement, it temporarily suspends its execution and returns the current value to the caller. The next time the function is called, it resumes execution from where it left off and continues generating the sequence.\n",

    "    For effective use of coroutines in python you can use the <b>async def</b> syntax instead of the regular <b>def</b> syntax. This tells Python that the function is a coroutine that can be paused and resumed, and that it should return a special type of object called a coroutine object instead of a regular function object and allows the usage of the keyword <b>await</b>.\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li> <b>await:</b> Used in Python to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete. When await is applied to a coroutine object, it suspends the execution of the current coroutine until the awaited coroutine is complete.            \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "Once you have defined a coroutine, you can create an instance of it using the await keyword, which sends a value to the coroutine and starts its execution. Once the coroutine is running, you can use the send() method to send values to it and resume its execution. The coroutine can then process the value that was sent and return a new value to the caller using the yield keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coroutines are particularly useful for implementing asynchronous programming in Python using the asyncio module. The asyncio module provides a way to run multiple coroutines concurrently and switch between them when one coroutine is waiting for I/O or some other blocking operation. This allows you to write asynchronous code that is both efficient and easy to understand.\n",
    "In addition to their use in asynchronous programming, coroutines can also be used for implementing cooperative multitasking, which is a technique for running multiple tasks on a single thread without blocking. This can be useful in situations where you want to maximize CPU utilization or when you are working with limited resources such as embedded systems.\n",

A programming paradigm is a style, philosophy or a set of principles followed in structuring your code and the way to implement its intended functionality. Among the various paradigms, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming\"><b>functional</b></a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming\"><b>object-oriented programming (OOP)</b></a> paradigm are the most popular, also in Python.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The functional paradigm</b> focusses on:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><b>Structuring your code</b>, so that the program uses subroutine/function calls (executing another program parts from elsewhere during the runtime).\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<b>Functions</b> in a mathematical sense <b>with arguments and return values</b>.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<b>Scoping, the limited visibility of an entity (e.g. the name binding of a variable) is implemented</b>, allowing for <b>local variables</b> and <b>isolation</b>.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<b>Functions allowing the reusability</b> of parts of the code since they <b>should ideally work as black boxes</b>.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "    <b>Statelessness</b>, hence <b>it shouldn't matter when a function is called.</b> As long as the same input is used, the function should yield the same output. <b>Hence functions are only loosely coupled to data</b> outside of their scope.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A <b>use case</b> is for <b>smaller projects or specialized scripts</b> where <b>new features are rather unlikely to be implemented.</b><br>\n",

    "<b>The data (its state) is strictly bound to the object.</b>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li><b>States</b> since the objects (can) store a state in their attributes. The interaction of these objects with the environment takes place via <b><i>special object methods</i></b>, the so-called <b><i>interfaces</i></b>, to avoid direct manipulation of object attributes from outside <b>ensuring data security.</b> <b>Statefulness implies</b> that the <b>execution order of object methods can matter.</b>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<b>Classes grouped in modules</b> so that the objects have the specific environments to work in. This allows <b>easy extensibility</b>.\n",

    "<b>Inheritance</b> allowing for a sub-class to inherit methods and attributes from the parent class.\n",

    "</li>\n",

    "A <b>use case</b> is a <v>big project</b> with <b>many collaborators</b> where the <b>task can be easily subdivided</b>, where <b>statefulness</b> is important and <b>new features are likely to be added.</b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Examples for other programming languages following this paradigm are Java, C++, Objective-C, Ruby or VB .NET.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The different paradigms are partly built on each other. <br><br>Both paradigms implement the <b>DRY</b>-principle (<b>D</b>on't <b>R</b>epeat <b>Y</b>ourself). <br><br> If possible, you always should try to outsource repeating code in functions or classes. <br><br> <b>This does not only improve the maintainability of your code, but also its readability and portability.</b>\n",

    "Inheritance allows to define a hierarchy of classes sharing the same base attributes and methods (interfaces). It can facilitate the implementation of new features in your code.<br><br> Inheritance is very often required when you work with big Python frameworks like the machine learning frameworks PyTorch or Tensorflow. There you write your own class by inheriting from a provided (abstract) class to comply with the interfaces or methods expected by the framework environment.<br><br>\n",
    "    <b>Multiple inheritance</b> is possible in Python, but only indirect via <a href=\"https://medium.com/@__hungrywolf/mro-in-python-3-e2bcd2bd6851\"><b>Method Resolution Order</b> (MRO)</a>, hence the object method are called in a specific order. An example is given below. <br><br>\n",

    "    <b>Method overloading</b> is also called <b><i>polymorphism</i></b> since multiple class methods of the <u>same name</u> can be defined, but accepting different numbers of arguments and types. Depending on which <i>signature</i> (number and data types of expected method arguments) of the method fits, the specific method in that case is selected and executed.<br><br>\n",
    "<b>In contrast to other programming languages like e.g. Java, a builtin implementation of polymorphism is not available in Python, hence it is not possible to define multiple methods of the same name, but accepting different number of arguments.</b> Polymorphism can only be implemented indirectly by default values for (keyword) arguments or variable number of arguments.\n",

    "The following example demonstrates the use of multiple dependent threads and how critical code sections are explicitly denoted with a lock (aquire/release). Normally Python automatically handles memory access of competing threads, but <b>to ensure a consistent, determined code behaviour, you need to define locks around critical code section explicitly.</b><br><br><b>Since the GIL exists to ensure thread-safety, threading does not parallelize your code!</b><br><br>In this context, it is also <b>important to distinguish atomic and non-atomic operations</b> in Python. <b>An atomic operation is an operation which cannot be interrupted by another running thread e.g. a function call of a builtin function.</b> For further reading, checkout <a href=\"https://opensource.com/article/17/4/grok-gil\">this</a>.\n",

    "<font size=\"3\">\n",
    "Depending on the application, an even easier way to parallelize your code (depending on what kind of parallelism is required) is to use the <a href=\"https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\"><i>joblib</i></a> package with which you can even build computing pipelines.<br><br>\n",
    "    <b>But you may need to fine tune the parameters <i>n_jobs</i> and <i>batch_size</i> and be aware of the additional overhead in creating workers. The individual tasks should take longer than the required time to spawn a new worker (rule of thumb, much longer than 1 second). Otherwise using <i>multiprocessing.Pool</i> or <i>joblib</i> is slower compared to a sequential execution.</b><br><br>\n",
    "To parallelize a part of the code, you just need to import the class <i>Parallel</i> and it expects (besides some additional parameters) a <i>generator</i> object, hence a <i>list comprehension</i> expression enclosed by round brackets. An example is shown below.\n",
