    "Iterators and generators are powerful features in Python that allow you to iterate over sequences of data, such as lists or dictionaries, or generate sequences of data on-the-fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through a collection of data one item at a time, without having to load the entire collection into memory at once. To create an iterator in Python, you define a specific class (we'll get to that later).\n",
    "A generator, on the other hand, is a special type of iterator that allows you to define a sequence of data on-the-fly, without having to create a separate class. Instead, you use the <i>yield</i> keyword to define a function that generates a sequence of values, one at a time. When the function encounters a yield statement, it temporarily suspends its execution and returns the current value to the caller. The next time the function is called, it resumes execution from where it left off and continues generating the sequence.\n",

    "</ul>    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, looping and iterators are closely connected. When we loop through objects like lists, dictionaries, and tuples, iterators are automatically used in the background. To manually iterate through a loop, we use the built-in next() function to get the next element of an iterator and the iter() statement to create an iterator object:\n",
